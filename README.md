jcalc is a calculator written in Java. This project began as a school assignment. The plan was originally for a text-based interpreter of basic operations, but it has since evolved a visual display and common functions. I created this repository to explore and share improvements to the calculator, and as a means for version control. Future goals for the project include: -Implied multiplication, eg. 8(3)=24 and with constants, 8(pi) -Implied change to previous answer, eg. +7=ans+7 -Improved functionality of variables, eg. use in functions -Throw user-friendly errors (IllegalArgumentException-->there was a problem with your input) -Development of various views (button view) -Ability to graph equations, graph(y=4x+3) etc
